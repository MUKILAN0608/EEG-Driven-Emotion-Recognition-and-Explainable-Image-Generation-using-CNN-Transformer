# EEG-Driven-Emotion-Recognition-and-Explainable-Image-Generation-using-CNN-Transformer
An end-to-end EEG-based emotion recognition and explainable image generation framework using a CNN–Transformer model. EEG signals are preprocessed, classified into emotions, interpreted with Grad-CAM, and converted into emotion-driven visual scenes using diffusion models for affective computing research.
